# Titanic Survival Prediction using XGBoost

![alt text](titanic.jpg)

This project demonstrates how to use the XGBoost algorithm to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. We'll walk through the steps of data preprocessing, model training, cross-validation, and result evaluation in Python.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers who traveled on the RMS Titanic. It includes features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. The goal of this project is to build a classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the necessary libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- xgboost
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy xgboost scikit-learn

```


## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/miracyuzakli/Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-XGBoost
cd titanic-xgboost
```


2. Run the `titanic-xgboost.py` script:

```
python titanic-xgboost.py

```


3. The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the XGBoost model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The script will display the test accuracy of the trained model. You can use this accuracy metric to assess the model's performance on predicting passenger survival.
